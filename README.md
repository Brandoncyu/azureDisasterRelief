# Wheel of Fortune
A basic wheel of fortune console app!

## Getting Started
Fork this repo and clone it locally. Open the file called 'WheelOfFortune.sln' in Visual Studio. Once you click run, the game will begin.

For reference, the hardcoded phrases are located in WOFClassLib.Tests/Phrase.cs

Once you begin you will be prompted for the number of users, and their names. 
You can attempt to guess a letter, but in true Wheel of Fortune fashion you may never attempt to guess a phrase before guessing a letter first. The spelling must be exact, but the game is case insensitive. 
Once someone guesses the phrase or last letter the game ends.

### Prerequisites
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
